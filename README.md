TinDog is a version of Tinder but for dogs.

The content of the website was provided by a Udemy course and the challenge was to construct a webpage using bootstrap while following a pdf for guidance. It was basically a labeled photo of how specific parts of the website should look and we would have to construct it. Although I did follow the pdf I have added many part of my own and changed much of the design and added content.   

This website is an active display of my Bootstrap and front end css properties.
